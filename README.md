# Calculator-Project

Weâ€™re aiming for the following goals for this project:

1.  A working Calculator:
    The main task is to create a Calculator not only will this test your understanding ofJavaScript but how you break down a problem.
2.  Practice using Git and GitHub flow:
    We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHuband the command line
3.  Apply what you are learning:
    This is a great place to apply what you have been learningon all of thecourse so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, BEM, anything else you findon the web....really go mad!
